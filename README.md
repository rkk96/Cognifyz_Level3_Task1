## Introduction
Machine learning offers a multitude of techniques to predict outcomes based on data. In this project, we evaluate various machine learning models to identify the most effective one for predicting ratings, ultimately selecting the Random Forest Regressor model for its high accuracy.

## Objectives
- Explore different machine learning techniques for rating prediction.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of various models.
- Select the best attributes for the model.
- Achieve a high prediction accuracy with the selected model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Google Colab**: For running Python code in a cloud environment.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library for Python.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Sklearn**: For Machine ;earning and Predicting.




## Usage
1. Open Google Colab and upload the notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Run the notebooks to explore different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
3. Modify the scripts in the `src/` directory to customize data processing and model selection.
